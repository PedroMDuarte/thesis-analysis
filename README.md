## Analyze density profiles of ultracold Fermionic gases

Here I present code to calculate the column density profile of ultracold
Fermionic gases starting from raw images taken using fluorescence, absorption,
or phase-contrast imaging.   

Fitting routines are provided to analyze the resulting density distributions.
In particular, fitting to a Thomas-Fermi distribution allows determination of
T/TF for a degenerate gas in a harmonic trap.
